### **Project Description**
Computer hide the number. It is required to guess this number within the minimum number of attempts

#### **Terms of the game:** 

*Option 1
Computer hides the number between 0 and 100. Computer itself shall guess the number. 
Therefore it is required to write an algorithm that would guess the hidden number.
The algorithm considers the information if the entered number is bigger or smaller.

*Option 2
Computer hides the number between 0 and 100. Computer itself shall guess the number. 
Therefore it is required to write an algorithm that would guess the hidden number. It is essentional that algorithm shall guess the number for less than 20 attempts.

#### **Outcome:**
Option 1: The result is how many attempts in average have been made within 1000 repetitions.

Option 2: The result is number of attempts is less than 20 in average within 1000 repetitions.

#### **Training outcome:**
Learning to write good algorithm in Python and public the project on GitHub
